I made the batter and separated it into two bowls, where i then added strawberry puree to one half, and melted salted caramel chocolate to the other half. From there i marbled it and added just a touch more flour to get a brownie batter consistency. Marble the batters together in a pan and bake. Delicious chocolate dipped strawverry brownies!

Using butter makes the cake denser, which many people complain about.  But this is exactly like the homemade cakes I grew up with, dense and not overly sweet, not like box or store bought cakes that you can mush into a goo ball.  I appreciate a cake with substance.

You can add your own taste to this. So the people complaining are just not using their imagination and adding their own spin onto it.  For mine I added cinnamon, nutmeg, cream cheese, butter bits bottom of the pan along with cinnamon on bottom.   Also added just a bit of fresh orange rined and squeezed just half the orange.  Its very good!  <br />Take a simple cake mix and add other things to it to make it your taste.

I found it to be flavorless and dense. It was also strangely dry but moist (like cornbread consistency).  I won't have a problem tossing the left overs instead of fighting my inner cake goddess for the scraps as I had hoped. It made a depressing day, more depressing. :'(","datePublished":"2021-07-06"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anonymous"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5"},"reviewBody":"It was a good cupcake, crispy on the top and soft on the inside.
