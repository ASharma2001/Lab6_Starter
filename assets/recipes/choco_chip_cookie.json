They bake up crispy on the edges and chewy inside. Feel free to vary the sprinkles and add some non pareils to the mix. Candy eyeballs come in various sizes so play around to see which combo you like best \u2013 we happen to think one medium and one large makes the monster look delightfully deranged.","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Food Network Kitchen","url":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/profiles/talent/food-network-kitchen"}],"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2021/08/25/0/FNK_Halloween-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies_H_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.406.305.suffix/1629898488636.jpeg","height":"406","width":"305","description":"Food Network Kitchen\u2019s Halloween Chocolate Chip Cookies, as seen on Food Network."},"datePublished":"2021-08-09T12:45:42.816-04:00","dateModified":"2021-08-09T12:45:41.978-04:00","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Food Network","url":"https://www.foodnetwork.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/etc/clientlibs/assets/images/food/fn-logo-flat-60x60.png","height":"60","width":"60"}},"keywords":"Chocolate Chip Cookie,Dessert,Halloween","cookTime":"P0Y0M0DT0H30M0.000S","totalTime":"P0Y0M0DT1H30M0.000S","recipeIngredient":["2 cups all-purpose flour","1 teaspoon baking powder ","1 teaspoon kosher salt ","1/2 teaspoon baking soda ","1 cup packed light brown sugar ","3/4 cup granulated sugar ","2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature ","2 large eggs ","2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract ","1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats ","1 cup mixed green, purple and orange candy-coated chocolates, such as M&Ms ","1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips ","1 cup mixed green, purple, orange and black Halloween sprinkles and nonpareils ","1/2 cup chopped pecans, optional ","48 candy eyeballs "],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Position an oven rack in the top and bottom and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
